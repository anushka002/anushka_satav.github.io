## Project Plan

> Research Question: 
> How can a mobile robot effectively combine vision, speech, and autonomous navigation to create a responsive and interactive system in real-world environments?

**Concept:** 

This project explores how TurtleBot4 can intelligently interact with its surroundings through vision-based object detection and speech-based communication. Using **TurtleBot 4 with Create 3 and Raspberry Pi**, our aim is to integrate:  

- **Real-time object detection** using **YOLOv8** for recognizing and categorizing objects in the environment.  
- **Voice command interaction** for user control, allowing spoken instructions to guide the robot's behavior.  
- **Autonomous navigation** with obstacle avoidance, ensuring safe and efficient movement in dynamic spaces.  
- **Dynamic responses** based on detected objects, enabling context-aware robotic actions.  
- **Fallback mechanisms** for handling hardware/software limitations and ensuring system robustness.

## Sensor Integration

**Utilization of Sensor Data**

![TurtleBotsFacing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfe928cf-b7cf-4cf4-82e4-b80c5853edfc)

> Check *Sensors Table* for more Information

- **Depth Camera (OAK-D/RealSense)**: Object detection and distance estimation.
- **LiDAR**: SLAM-based navigation and obstacle detection.
- **IMU**: Enhancing motion stability and drift correction.
- **Microphone**: Capturing voice commands.
- **Speaker**: Responding with audio feedback.

**Testing and Demonstration**

- **Unit Testing**: Each sensor tested in isolation.
- **Integration Testing**: Validating sensor fusion for decision-making.
- **Final Demonstration**: Robot detects objects, responds to queries, follows voice commands, and navigates autonomously.

## Interaction Mechanism

**Behavioral Influence & Interfaces**

- **Voice Command API**: Users instruct the robot using predefined phrases.
- **ROS2 RQT GUI/Web Dashboard**: For remote monitoring.

*(Include a professional-looking UI sketch showing how users will interact with the system.)*

## Control & Autonomy

- **Sensor-Driven Control Loop**: Robot makes decisions based on camera, LiDAR, and IMU inputs.
- **ROS2 Navigation Stack**: Used for path planning and movement.
- **Hierarchical Decision Model**: Combining high-level commands with low-level execution.

## Final Demonstration Plan

### Setup & Execution

- **Classroom Resources**: Open space for navigation demo.
- **Demonstration Steps**: The robot will identify objects, respond to user queries, navigate obstacles, and execute spoken commands.

### Handling Environmental Variability (future scope)

- **Adaptive Algorithms**: Adjust object detection thresholds dynamically.
- **Fallback Modes**: If detection fails, switch to manual control or alternative recognition models.

### Testing & Evaluation Plan

- **Simulated Testing in Gazebo** before real-world deployment.
- **Comparison Metrics**:
  - Object recognition accuracy.
  - Speech command response time.
  - Navigation success rate.

## Impact

This project will:

- Advance AI-driven robotics interactions for smart environments.
- Develop speech-integrated autonomous systems.
- Provide students hands-on experience with ROS2, AI, and embedded systems.
- Potentially contribute to assistive robotics research.
